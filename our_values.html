								<h3>Our Values</h3>
								<p>
									At Swing In Utrecht, our mission is to promote the joy of swing music and celebrate a vibrant community in Utrecht that embraces diversity, fosters inclusivity, and provides a safe space for all.
									SwingDom aims to be the embodiment of these values, where we come together to celebrate the spirit of jazz, honor its roots.
									Below we explain our values and some ways we aim to implement them.

											<b>Celebration of Swing and Jazz and its Roots:</b> SwingDom Festival is an homage to the mesmerizing rhythms of jazz music and its rich historical roots. We honor the pioneering musicians and their contributions to swing music and dancing, while celebrating the cultural significance of African (American) art, in particular in the context of swing dancing. In previous years we’ve always had space for talk and education on the history of jazz and swing. We always want to put in extra effort to increase the visibility of the roots of (swing) dancing.

											<b>Inclusivity & Diversity:</b> SwingDom Festival is a space for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, (neuro)diversity, or background. We believe in creating an environment where all feel welcome and can enjoy the music and dance without barriers. We take it very seriously to make SwingDom a safe and welcoming event for everyone. That’s why we work with a code of conduct and have a care team that will be easily recognizable with badges.
											<br></br>
											<b>Creativity:</b> We believe in fostering and celebrating creativity in all its forms. SwingDom Festival embraces artistic expression, encourages participants to explore their creative potential, and provides a platform for innovative ideas to flourish. We always aim to make creativity a part of the festival, bringing the focus to how you move your body and express yourself.

										<p>
											<b>Community:</b> We recognize the power of building connections through music and dance. SwingDom Festival encourages collaboration, friendship, and a sense of belonging among all participants. Together, we can create a supportive and tight-knit community. That is why we have our previously posted Solidarity Fund, through which we support each other. SwingDom is a festival created by dancers, for dancers. We are happy to share the spirit of our local community with our guests and celebrate all those who contribute to our festival.
											<br></br>
											<b>Self-Care:</b> We understand the importance of self-care and strive to create an environment that encourages participants to prioritize their physical and mental well-being. Considering our late parties, we provide opportunities for relaxation and mindful practices that promote self-nurturing.
