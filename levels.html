										<td>Lindy Hop</td>
										<td>Level 1</td>
										<td>You have been dancing about a year and are no longer an absolute beginner. You have attended some socials and started feeling comfortable on the social dance floor. This might just be your first (international) festival. You know for most moves at least the 'basic versions'.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Lindy Hop</td>
										<td>Level 2</td>
										<td>You have been dancing for about 1.5 to 2 years, are frequently attending local events, and might have visited a few festivals. You are starting to think about your dances further than just moves. Themes like musicality, flow etc. are things you are now focusing on! You've probably attended a festival already, but maybe not that many yet.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Lindy Hop</td>
										<td>Level 3</td>
										<td>Dancing for 2+ years, dancing has become a big part of your life. You are on the social dance floor regularly and went to a few Lindy Hop festivals. Slow and medium tempo feel comfortable, and you like to even try dancing to faster ones. A decent number of figures (both basic &  more complex) are familiar to you. You’re exploring styling rhythm, connection, and musicality</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Lindy Hop</td>
										<td>Level 4</td>
										<td>You’ve been dancing for 4+ years and are really trying to get to the details of your dancing. You have been adding a lot of personal style to your dancing already and want to explore this more through conceptual themes. You have no problem dancing any tempo and mixing in footwork variations, stylings and solo jazz. You visit many socials and go to festivals on a frequent basis.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Solo Jazz</td>
										<td>Intermediate</td>
										<td>You are no longer an absolute beginner and you start feeling comfortable on the social dance floor dancing solo. You might even have had one or two solo jazz courses before and/or know of the traditional routines such as the tranky doo etc. In this level you will learn variations on the vernacular jazz steps and open doors to improvisation on the dance floor.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Solo Jazz</td>
										<td>Advanced</td>
										<td>You are starting to develop your own individual style and experimenting and have been dancing solo jazz regularly for over a year. You like improvising to the music and connecting with other solo jazz dancers on the dance floor. You want to improve your self-expression and technique while staying connected to the music.</td>
