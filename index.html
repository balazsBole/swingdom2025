		<script type="text/template" id="bigFiveModalText">
			We are very happy to have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebigfivejazzberlin/" target="_blank">The Big Five</a> share their music.
			</br>Inspired by the wild hot sounds of 1930s/40s Harlem and Chicago jazz, The Big Five have established themselves as Berlin’s most authentic swing-era combo. Combining a driving rhythm section, a fiery horn-led frontline and dynamic song-arrangements, this international band makes a deep-dive into the lesser-known repertoire of the Swing Golden Age - as well as a strong emphasis on original compositions.
			</br>The Big Five are veterans of Berlin’s famed Lindy-hop and Balboa dance-halls and know how to turn a mild-mannered dance party into a raging frenzy of swing-outs.
		</script>

		<script type="text/template" id="samModalText">
			It's becoming a tradition to have a Blues After Party at SwingDom.
			</br>This year on Saturday night you can groove to the tunes of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samghezzi/" target="_blank">Sam Ghezzi</a> and mystery guest, (as Sam Ghezzi Blues Duo) in Le Clochard.
			</br>Expect amazing music, a packed dance floor and cozy vibes. This band will keep you moving till the early hours.

		<script type="text/template" id="roaringCatsModalText">
			We are very happy to welcome back <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roaring.cats/" target="_blank">Roaring Cats</a>, and have them share their wonderful music at our SwingDom 2025 Sunday Party.
			</br>The Roaring Cats will take us right back to the ’20s and ‘30s of New Orleans with their repertoire ranging from smooth slow-passed songs to swinging high tempo jazz. Get ready to dance the night away!

		<script type="text/template" id="makaModalText">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/makayavelic/" target="_blank">Maka</a> is a multi-talented dancer, musician and DJ, which shows in his teaching! We’re excited to welcome him to SwingDom this year. Here’s a message from him to you:
			</br> “Hi, my name is Maka. I do lindy and solo, and I also DJ at many festivals. I also play lots of instruments in lots of bands and teach lessons and workshops about musicality. But above all, I have a lot of respect for the rare people who read the teachers' descriptions! So, if you come to me with the password "dogmatic squid", I'll try to tell you a joke to congratulate this noble gesture of yours.”

		<script type="text/template" id="ailsaModalText">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ai_l_sa/" target="_blank">Ailsa</a>(France) discovered Lindy Hop in Edinburgh in 2016 and hasn’t looked back since. After travelling around Europe in search of festivals and social dancing, she landed in Toulouse where she continued to learn more about the different swing dances as well as the dance’s history, the music and the culture that gives these dances their depth and richness.
			</br>A teacher by training, Ailsa's passion for sharing her love of dance prompted her to start teaching and she now teaches Lindy Hop, Solo jazz / Charleston and Solo Blues full time. She also teaches at festivals across Europe and organises her own festival: MEET THE MUSIC.
			</br>She loves to challenge herself and keep learning, which has led her to compete in competitions, perform, and to explore other dance styles. Ailsa loves the music and energy that swing dances are built upon and wants to share this with her students.

		<script type="text/template" id="albertoModalText">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/alberto__meucci/" target="_blank">Alberto</a> discovered Lindy Hop in 2015 and it was love from the very first dance.
			</br>He sees inspiration in every Lindy Hopper – regardless of whether it is his teacher or student – each meeting on the dance floor brings something new. Dancing gives him energy and a curiosity to always learn more about the history of the dance. His pockets are full of rhythmic variations and …jokes. He comes from picturesque Genoa in Italy, while currently he lives and teaches in Warsaw.
			</br>Ana and Alberto met and hit it off on the social dance floor, where they quickly realized they connected in and out of it. They keep their classes fun, welcoming and challenging, aiming to create thoughtful conversation with those who take their class, both in the dance material and discussions they prompt towards the classroom.
		</script>

		<script type="text/template" id="anaModalText">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/nutriadelmonte/" target="_blank">Ana</a> is a guest in Afro-American dance culture: social dancer & teacher from Granada (Spain) currently residing in Berlin, where she is the founder of Rayuela Swing, the school where she teaches and organizes events.
			</br>Her classes focus on communal sharing and learning by trying, with more dancing than explanations taking place. In her classes she strives to create an environment where partnered and solo dance can feel like an exploration, rather than mechanical repetition of patterns. Her space in the classroom is dictated by her belief that by approaching the dance with humility and respect, we can honor its legacy and share its beauty with others in a meaningful and authentic way.

		<script type="text/template" id="ariAndSimonModalText">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ariandsimon/" target="_blank">Ari and Simon</a> are primarily focused on Lindy Hop and Authentic Jazz. They are passionate about these dance forms, especially in the context of their cultural traditions, their values and their place as an art form.
			</br>Working together since 2016, they are now based in Madrid working globally as well as growing their online platform through Patreon.
			</br>They are an energetic and rhythmical couple who love the interplay between the individual, the music and the partner during a dance and how it can develop into a beautiful conversation.
			</br>They hold titles from the International Lindy Hop Championships, The Savoy Cup and The Korean Lindy Hop Championships, among others. Their passion for the dance and the culture of swing has grown with them and is something they constantly strive to develop and express, whether in classes, on stage or in competition.

		<script type="text/template" id="gustavModalText">
			Gustav grew up in a family devoted to dance, although he was more focused on sports during his early years. Around 20 years ago, he attended Herräng Dance Camp to try Lindy Hop — and was lucky enough to have one of his first classes with the legendary Frankie Manning. He instantly fell in love with the dance and has since dedicated himself to learning and deepening his understanding of this amazing art form.
			</br>Originally from Sweden, Gustav is now based in Barcelona, where he dances and teaches. His teaching focuses on rhythm and flow, and he continually works to refine his movement and rhythm through practicing Tap, Solo Jazz, and Lindy Hop.

		<script type="text/template" id="lauraModalText">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lauraglaess/" target="_blank">Laura</a> has been an influential voice in Lindy Hop competition, performance, and education for the past 20 years. She has won countless awards and acknowledgements at international competitions, and has taught at festivals in 22 countries spanning 5 continents.
			</br>She has performed at the Joyce, Jacob’s Pillow, and the Guggenheim, as well as at Lindy Hop and Authentic Jazz festivals worldwide. She is a guest instructor at Steps on Broadway. Her YouTube channel dedicated to Lindy Hop history, vocabulary, partnering, and body movement is one of the most popular and influential in the scene.
